    "After the intial fun with LLMs, asking the capital of random countries and getting them to tell lousy jokes or write wack poems, the next area I've found people trying to figure out is how to \"chat their documents\". In other words, can you give an LLM access to some documents, databases, web pages, etc. and get them to use that context for more specialized discussion and applications? This is more formally called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual I shan't spend too much time explaining fundamental AI principles in these articles which are focused on the MLX framework. For a very high level view of RAG, see [this synopsis from the Prompt Engineering Guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/rag), or better yet, see [this full article from the same source](https://www.promptingguide.ai/research/rag). The latter is a long read, but really important if you're trying to advance from baby steps to almost any sophisticated use of LLMs. In any case, you'll need to understand at least the basics of RAG to get the most of this article.\n",

    "In this article I'll show through code examples how you can start to build RAG apps to work with LLM generation on MLX. It's a big subtopic, even just to get through the basics, so I'll break it into two parts, the first of which focuses on the retrieval portion.\n",

    "# Trying out a vector DBMS\n",
    "\n",
    "So far in these articles the main benefit of MLX has been GenAI accelerated on Apple Silicon's Metal architecture. That's all about the \"G\" in RAG. It would be great to have the \"R\" part also taking some advantage of Metal, but that proves a bit tougher than I'd expected. Many of the best-known vector DBs (faiss, qdrant, etc.) use various techniques to accelerate embedding and perhaps lookup via GPU, but they focus on Nvidia (CUDA) and in some cases AMD (ROCm), with nothing for Metal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following a hint from [Prince Canuma](https://huggingface.co/prince-canuma) I found [vliteâ€”\"a simple and blazing fast vector database\"](https://github.com/sdan/vlite) whose docs include the promising snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - `device` (optional): The device to use for embedding ('cpu', 'mps', or 'cuda'). Default is 'cpu'. 'mps' uses PyTorch's Metal Performance Shaders on M1 macs, 'cuda' uses a NVIDIA GPU for embedding generation.\n",
    "\n",

    "When I first tried this, the results were terrible. RAG is always trickier than you may think, and there are many considerations to designing an effective RAG pipeline. One key one is how the content is partitioned within the vector DB, because each query will try to match and respond with particular chunks of text based on the query. By default vlite takes a naive approach of creating sequential chunks with up to 512 token length.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Wait, what are tokens again?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokens have come up before in this series, and you might be wondering. \"What are those, exactly?\" Tokens are a really important concept with LLMs. When an LLM is dealing with language, it doesn't do so character by character, but it breaks down a given language into statistically useful groupings of characters, which are then identified with integer numbers. For example the characters \"ing\" occur pretty frequently, so a tokenizer might group those as a single token in many circumstances. It's sensitive to the surrounding character sequence, though, so the word \"sing\" might well be encoded as a single token of its own, regardless of containing \"ing\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to get a feel of LLM tokenization is to play around with sample text and see how it gets converted. Luckily there are many tools out there to help, including [the simple llama-tokenizer-js playground](https://belladoreai.github.io/llama-tokenizer-js/example-demo/build/) web app which allows you to enter text and see how the popular Llama LLMs would tokenize them.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Quick exampls with the online Llama tokenizer](../assets/images/2024/tokenizer-examples.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The colors don't mean anything special in themselves. They're just visual tiling to separate the tokens. Notice how start of text is a special token `<s>`. You might remember we also encountered some other special tokens such as `<|im_start|>` (begin conversation turn) in previous articles. LLM pre-training and fine-tuning changes the way things are tokenized, as part of setting the entire model of language. Llama won't tokenize exactly as, say ChatGPT does, but the basic concepts stay the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "The picture shows an example of how markup such as HTML can affect tokenization. There are models such as the commercial [Docugami](https://www.docugami.com/) which are trained towards efficient tokenization of markup. Code-specialized LLMs such as those used in programmer copilot tools would have efficient tokenizations of the sorts of constructs which are more common in programming code than in natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating more sensible chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "In effect, the tokenization establishes the shape of language in a model. As such, it makes some sense, if you absolutely know no better, to at least use token boundaries in chunking text for vector lookups. We can do even better, though. Just as a basic approach it would be better to chunk each paragraph in these articles separately. That way you have a coherent thread of meaning in each chunk which is more likely to align, say with input from the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code I take over the chunking from vlite, using the `text_split` function available in [my company's open source OgbujiPT package](https://github.com/OoriData/OgbujiPT). Instead of fixed chunk sizes, I split by Markdown paragraphs (`\\n\\n`), with a guideline that chunks should be kept under 100 characters where possible.\n",
