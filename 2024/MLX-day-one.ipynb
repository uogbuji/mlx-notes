    "# Apple MLX for AI/Large Language Modelsâ€”Day One\n",
    "\n",
    "_Author: Uche Ogbuji_\n",
    "\n",
    "I've been using llama.cpp on Mac Silicon for months now, and [my brother, Chimezie](https://huggingface.co/cogbuji) has been nudging me to give [MLX](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx) a go.\n",
    "I finally set aside time today to get started, with an eventual goal of adding support for MLX model loading & usage in [OgbujiPT](https://github.com/OoriData/OgbujiPT). I'd been warned it's rough around the edges, but it's been stimulating to play with. I thought I'd capture some of my notes, including some pitfalls I ran into, which might help anyone else trying to get into MLX in its current state.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a quick bit of background I'll mention that MLX is very interesting because honestly, Apple has the most coherently engineered consumer and small-business-level hardware for AI workloads, with Apple Silicon and its unified memory. The news lately is all about Apple's AI fumbles, but I suspect their clever plan is to empower a community of developers to take the arrows in their back and build things out for them. The MLX community is already an absolute machine, a fact Chimezie spotted early on. If like me you're trying to develop products on this new frontier without abdicating the engineering to separate, black-box providers, MLX is a compelling avenue.\n",

    "\n",
    "My initial forays will just be into inferencing, which should complement the large amount of solid community work in MLX fine-tuning and other more advanced topics. There's plenty of nuance to dig into just on the inference side, though.\n",
    "As I was warned, it's clear that MLX is developing with great velocity, even by contemporary AI standards, so just as some resources I found from six weeks ago were already out of date, this could also well be by the time you come across it. I'll try to update and continue taking notes on developments as I go along, though.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, I installed the mlx_lm package for Python, following the [instructions from HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/mlx). After switching to a suitable Python virtual environment:"

On llama.cpp my go-to has been [OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B](https://huggingface.co/teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B), so my first move was to try to run that on MLX. I had read MLX gained limited GGUF model file format support recently, with limited support for quantization outputs. If this sentence has been gobbledygook to you,\n",

It used the `.NPZ` format, which seems to be out of date and [yet is still referenced in the docs](https://ml-explore.github.io/mlx/build/html/examples/llama-inference.html#converting-the-weights).\n",
