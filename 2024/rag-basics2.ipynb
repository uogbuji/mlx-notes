    "# Retrieval augmentation with MLX: A bag full of RAG, part 2\n",
    "14 June 2024. Versions: mlx: 0.15.0 | mlx-lm: 0.14.3\n",
    "_Author: [Uche Ogbuji](https://ucheog.carrd.co/)_\n",
    "\n",
    "[In the first part of this article](https://github.com/uogbuji/mlx-notes/blob/main/2024/rag-basics1.md) I made a basic introduction to Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a technique for integrating content retrieved from databases or other sources into prompts for LLM. In the first part I showed how you might construct such a context database (retrieval), and in this part we'll see how the content can be stuffed into the prompt for the LLM in the generation phase. You'll want to read part 1 before proceeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Back to the land of LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "While fiddling with the vector database we haven't got around yet to using the G (Generation) part of RAG. The results from vector DB lookup are exact raw chunks of content. What you usually want in such scenarios, is for the LLM to take this raw content and work it into a coherent response to the user. A next step is to stuff the retrieved text into the prompt, as context, along with some instructions (generally placed in a system prompt). If all goes well, the LLM's response proves useful, and is anchored by the facts retrieved from the vector DB, lowering the LLM's tendency to hallucinate.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Aside: Hallucination is one of the most misunderstood topics in GenAI. It's always important to remember what LLMs are trained to do: they are trained to complete the text provided in the prompt. They are just predicting tokens and generating language. This means that they will sometimes generate language whose meaning is confusing, false or misleading, which we call hallucinations, but in doing so, they are merely following their training._\n",
    "\n",
    "_A part of the solution is to include in the prompt facts and instructions which are carefully constructed (i.e. prompt engineered) according to an understanding of the LLM's statistical tendencies. This reduces the likelihood of hallucinations, but it may not be possible to completely eliminate that tendency. Some LLMs are trained or fine-tuned to be especially \"obedient\" to the context, and these are good choices for RAG. Picking the right LLM is another part of the solution; using multi-stage pipelines with verification by other LLMs or even people (perhaps from a random or heuristically selected sample of transcripts) is another part of the solution. RAG is a simple concept, but getting consistently great results with it involves complex considerations_\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prompt stuffing 101\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous article, [Listing 4 (qdrant_build_db.py)](https://github.com/uogbuji/mlx-notes/tree/main/assets/resources/2024/ragbasics/listings) created a Qdrant vector database from the markdown of articles in this series. We can now use that database to retrieve likely chunks of content and stuff these in the prompt for the generation phase of RAG. Listing 1, below, is a simple example of this process, using the MLX generation interface explored in previous articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code first queries the vector database for chunks of content semantically similar to the user question or prompt, which is hard-coded for simplicity. It then pulls the chunks into a template to construct an overall prompt, which is sent to the LLM for completion.\n",

    "### Faster prompt processing\n",
    "\n",
    "One detail that popped out to my eye, from an MLX perspective, was the generation speed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Prompt: 443.319 tokens-per-sec\n",
    "Generation: 44.225 tokens-per-sec\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Back in April I was seeing the following report (same 2021 Apple M1 Max MacBook Pro with 64GB RAM):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Prompt: 84.037 tokens-per-sec\n",
    "Generation: 104.326 tokens-per-sec\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The generation speed looks slower now, but the prompt processing speed is some 5X faster, and in RAG applications, whre the prompt gets stuffed with retrieved data, this is an important figure. That said, this is a completely different model from the `h2o-danube2-1.8b-chat-MLX-4bit` from the earlier article, and many aspects of the model itself can affect prompt processing and generation speeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model I've used in the code above is my new favorite, general-purpose, open-source model, `Hermes-2-Theta-Llama-3-8B`, and in particular [a 4 bit quant I converted to MLX and contributed to the community myself](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/Hermes-2-Theta-Llama-3-8B-4bit), using techniques from my previous article in this series, [\"Converting models from Hugging Face to MLX format, and sharing\"](https://github.com/uogbuji/mlx-notes/blob/main/2024/conversion-etc.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Going beyond\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the basic bones of RAG. Using just the code so far, you already have a lot of basis for experimentation. You can change the chunk size of the data stored in the vector DB—an adjustment which might surprise you in the degree of its effects. You can play with `SCORE_THRESHOLD` and `MAX_CHUNKS` to dial up or down what gets stuffed into the prompt for generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's just scratching the surface. There are a dizzying array of techniques and variations to RAG. Just to name a selection, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* use overlap with the chunking, so that you're less likely to chop apart or orphan the context of each chunk\n",
    "* have multiple levels of chunking, e.g. chunking document section headers as well as their contents, sometimes called hierarchical RAG\n",
    "* base the retrieval on more basic SQL or other traditional database query rather than vector search, perhaps even using a coding LLM to generate the SQL (yes, there are special security implications to this)\n",
    "* use text matching rather than semantic vector search\n",
    "* take retrieved chunks and re-summarize them using an LLM before sending them for generation (contextual compression), or re-assess their relevance (reranking)\n",
    "* retrieve and stuff with structured knowledge graphs rather than loose text\n",
    "* use an LLM to rewrite the user's prompt to better suit the context (while maintaining fidelity to the original)\n",
    "* structure the stuffing of the prompts into a format to match the training of a context obedient generation LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course you can mix and match all the above, and so much more. RAG is really just an onramp to engineering, rather than its destination. As I continue this article series, I'll probably end up touching on many other advanced RAG techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, you have a basic idea of how to use RAG in MLX, and you're mostly limited by your imagination. Load up your retrieval DB with your your company's knowledgebase to create a customer self-help bot. Load it up with your financials to create a prep tool for investor reporting. Load up with all your instant messages so you can remember whom to thank about that killer restaurant recommendation once you get around to trying it. Since you're using a locally-hosted LLM, courtesy MLX, you can run such apps entirely airgapped and have few of the privacy concerns from using e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic or Google.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Its data all the way down\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of AI has always been high quality data at high volume. RAG, if anything makes this connection far more obvious. If you want to gain its benefits, you have to be ready to commit to sound data architecture and management. We all know that garbage in leads to garbage out, but it's especially pernicious to deal with garbage out that's been given a spit shine by an eager LLM during generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot of energy around RAG projects, but they hide a dirty little secret: they tend to look extremely promising in prototype phases, and then run into massive engineering difficulties on the path towards full product status. A lot of this is because, to be frank, organizations have often spent so much time cutting corners in their data engineering that they just don't have the right fuel for RAG, and they might not even realize where their pipelines are falling short.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is essentially the main grown-up LLM technique we have right now. It's at the heart of many product initiatives, including many of my own ones. Don't ever think, however, that it's a cure-all for the various issues in GenAI, such as hallucination and unpredictable behavior. In addition to making sure you have your overall data engineering house in order, be ready to implement sound AI Ops, with a lot of testing and ongoing metrics. There's no magic escape from this if you want to take the benefits of AI at scale.\n",

I mean the crowd starts by rhythmically chanting \"DeeeeeeJaaaaay, we wanna paaaaartaaaaay\", and not three minutes in a dude from the crowd jumps in with a saxophone.
